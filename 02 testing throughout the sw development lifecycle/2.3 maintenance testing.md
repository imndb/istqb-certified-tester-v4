# 2.3. Maintenance Testing

**different categories of maintenance** (see ISO/IEC 14764 for details)
* it can be **corrective**,
* **adaptive** to changes in the environment,
* to improve **performance**,
* to improve **maintainability**

**so maintenance can involv**e:
* **planned** releases/deployments and
* **unplanned** releases/deployments (hot fixes)

**impact analysis**
* may be done **before a change** is made, **to help decide** if the change should be made,
* based on the potential consequences in other areas of the system
* **testing** the changes to **a system in production includes** both
  + **evaluating the success of the implementation** of the change and
  + **checking for possible regressions** in parts of the system that remain unchanged
    - which is usually most of the system

**the scope of maintenance testing** typically **depends on**:
* the degree of *risk* of the change
* the size of the existing system
* the size of the change

**the triggers for maintenance and maintenance testing** can be classified as follows:
* **modifications**,
  + such as planned enhancements (ie. release-based),
* **corrective changes** or **hot fixes**
* **upgrades or migrations of the operational environment**,
  + such as from one platform to another, which can require
    - **tests** associated with the **new environment** as well as of **the changed software**, or
    - **tests** of **data conversion** when data from another application is migrated into the system being maintained
* **retirement**, eg. when an application reaches the end of its life
  + retirement of a system can require **testing of data archiving**
    - if long data-retention periods are required
  + **testing of restore and retrieval procedures** after archiving may also be needed
    - in the event that certain data is required during the archiving period
