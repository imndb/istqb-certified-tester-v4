# 5.2. Risk Management

organizations face many **internal & external factors**
* that **make it uncertain whether and when** they will achieve their objectives (ISO 31000)

***risk management*** allows the organizations to
  + **increase the likelihood** of achieving objectives,
  + **improve the quality** of their products
  + **increase** the stakeholdersâ€™ **confidence** and trust

**the main *risk management* activities**:
* ***risk analysis***
  + consisting of *risk* identification and *risk assessment*; see section 5.2.3
* ***risk control***
  + consisting of *risk mitigation* and *risk monitoring*; see section 5.2.4

***risk-based testing***
* is the *test approach*, in which
  + **test activities** are selected, prioritized, and managed
    - **based on *risk analysis* and *risk control***

## 5.2.1. Risk Definition and Risk Attributes

**risk** def.
* a potential event, hazard, threat, or situation whose occurrence **causes an adverse effect**
* a *risk* can be characterized by **two factors:**
  + ***risk* likelihood**
    - the probability of the *risk* occurrence (greater than zero and less than one)
  + ***risk* impact (harm)**
    - the consequences of this occurrence
* **these** two factors **express the *risk level***: a measure for the *risk*
  + the higher the *risk level*, the more important is its treatment

## 5.2.2. Project Risks and Product Risks

in software testing we are generally concerned with **two types of *risks***:
* *project risks*
* *product risks*

***project risks***
* are related to the management and control of the project
* ***project risks* include**:
  + **organizational issues**
    - eg. delays in work products deliveries, inaccurate estimates, cost-cutting
  + **people issues**
    - eg. insufficient skills, conflicts, communication problems, shortage of staff
  + **technical issues**
    - eg. scope creep, poor tool support
  + **supplier issues**
    - eg. third-party delivery failure, bankruptcy of the supporting company
* when they occur, *project risks* **may have an impact on**
  + the project schedule,
  + budget or scope,
  + which affects the project's ability to achieve its objectives

***product risks***
* are related to the product quality characteristics,
  + eg. described in the ISO 25010 quality model
* ***product risks* include**:
  + missing or wrong functionality,
  + incorrect calculations,
  + runtime errors,
  + poor architecture,
  + inefficient algorithms,
  + inadequate response time,
  + poor user experience,
  + security vulnerabilities
* *product risks* **may result in various negative consequences**, including:
  + user dissatisfaction
  + loss of revenue, trust, reputation
  + damage to third parties
  + high maintenance costs, overload of the helpdesk
  + criminal penalties
  + in extreme cases, physical damage, injuries or even death

## 5.2.3. Product Risk Analysis

from a testing perspective, the **goal of *product risk* analysis**:
* to provide an **awareness of *product risk***
  + in order to focus the testing effort in a way
    - that minimizes the residual level of *product risk*
* **ideally**, *product risk* analysis begins **early** in the SDLC

***product risk* analysis**
* **consists of**
  + *risk* identification and
  + *risk* assessment

***risk* identification**
* is about generating **a comprehensive list of *risks***
* stakeholders can identify *risks* **by using various techniques and tools**,
  + eg. brainstorming, workshops, interviews, or cause-effect diagrams

***risk assessment***
* **involves**:
  + categorization of identified *risks*,
  + determining their *risk* likelihood,
  + *risk* impact and level,
  + prioritizing,
  + proposing ways to handle them
* **categorization helps in assigning mitigation actions**,
  + because usually *risks* falling into the same category,
    - they can be mitigated using a similar approach
* *risk assessment* can use a **quantitative** or **qualitative approach**, or **a mix of them**
  + **quantitative approach**:
    - the *risk level* is calculated as the multiplication of *risk* likelihood and *risk* impact
  + **qualitative approach**:
    - the *risk level* can be determined using a *risk* matrix

*product risk* analysis **may influence the thoroughness and scope of testing**
* its **results are used to**
  + determine the scope of testing to be carried out
  + determine the particular *test levels* and propose *test types* to be performed
  + determine the *test techniques* to be employed and the *coverage* to be achieved
  + estimate the test effort required for each task
  + prioritize testing in an attempt to find the critical *defects* as early as possible
  + determine whether any activities in addition to testing could be employed to reduce *risk*

## 5.2.4. Product Risk Control

***product risk* control**
* comprises **all measures that are taken** in response to identified & assessed *product risks*
* **consists of** *risk mitigation* and *risk monitoring*
* ***risk mitigation***
  + involves implementing the actions proposed in *risk assessment* to reduce the *risk level*
* ***risk monitoring***, aiming:
  + to ensure that the mitigation actions are effective,
  + to obtain further information to improve *risk assessment*,
  + to identify emerging *risks*

with respect to *product risk* control, **once** a *risk* has been **analyzed**, **several response options** to *risk* are possible, eg.
* *risk mitigation* by testing,
* *risk* acceptance,
* *risk* transfer,
* contingency plan (Veenendaal 2012)

**actions** that can be taken **to mitigate the *product risks* by testing**:
* select the testers with the right level of experience and skills, suitable for a given *risk* type
* apply an appropriate level of independence of testing
* conduct *reviews* and perform *static analysis*
* apply the appropriate *test techniques* and *coverage* levels
* apply the appropriate *test types* addressing the affected quality characteristics
* perform *dynamic testing*, including *regression testing*
