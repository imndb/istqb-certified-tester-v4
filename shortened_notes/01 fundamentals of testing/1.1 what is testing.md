# 1.1 What is Testing?

**Software testing** def.:
* a set of activities **to discover *defects*** and **evaluate the quality of** software artifacts
* these artifacts, when being tested, are known as *test objects*
* it **assesses software quality** and **helps reducing the *risk*** of software *failure* in operation

**common misconception #1**: testing only consists of executing tests
* but:
  + it also includes other activities,
  + it must be aligned with the *software development lifecycle*

**common misconception #2**: testing focuses entirely on verifying the *test object*
* but:
  + while testing involves *verification*:
  + it also involves *validation*:

testing may be ***dynamic* or *static***
* **dynamic testing** involves the execution of software,
  + uses **different types of *test techniques*** and **test approaches** to derive *test cases* (see chapter 4).
* **static testing** does not
  + it includes **reviews** (see chapter 3) and ***static analysis***

testing is **not only a technical activity**:
* it needs to be properly **planned, managed, estimated, monitored** and **controlled** (see chapter 5)
* testers use tools (see chapter 6), but it is **largely an intellectual activity** requiring
  + **specialized knowledge**,
  + **analytical skills**,
  + **critical thinking** and **systems thinking** (Myers 2011, Roman 2018)
* ISO/IEC/IEEE 29119-1 standard: further information about software testing concepts

## 1.1.1 Test Objectives

**typical test objectives**:
* **evaluating work products**,
* **triggering *failures*** and **finding *defects***
* **ensuring required *coverage*** of a *test object*
* **reducing the level of *risk*** of inadequate software quality
* ***verifying* specified requirements**
* ***verifying* contractual, legal, and regulatory requirements**
* **providing information to stakeholders**
* **building confidence in the quality** of the *test object*
* ***validating* whether the *test object* is complete** and works as expected

objectives of testing can **vary, depending upon the context**, which includes:
* **the work product** being tested,
* **the *test level***,
* ***risks***,
* **the *software development lifecycle*** (SDLC) being followed,
* factors related to the **business context**,
  + eg. corporate structure, competitive considerations, or time to market

## 1.1.2 Testing and Debugging

testing and debugging are separate activities

**testing**
* **can trigger *failures*** that are caused by *defects* in the software (*dynamic testing*)
* or **can directly find *defects*** in the *test object* (*static testing*)

**debugging**
* **when *dynamic testing* (see chapter 4) triggers a *failure***, debugging is concerned with:
  + finding causes of this *failure* (*defects*), analyzing these causes, and eliminating them
  + **typical debugging process** in this case:
    - reproduction of a *failure*
    - diagnosis: finding the *root cause*
    - fixing the cause
  + **subsequent *confirmation testing*** checks whether the fixes resolved the problem
    - preferably done by the same person who performed the initial test
  + **subsequent *regression testing*** can also be performed,
  + see section 2.2.3 for *confirmation testing* and *regression testing*
* **when *static testing* identifies a *defect***, debugging is concerned with removing it
  + no need for reproduction or diagnosis,
    - since *static testing* directly finds defects,
    - and cannot cause *failures* (see chapter 3)
