# 1.3 Testing Principles

testing principles are general guidelines
* this syllabus describes seven such principles

**1. testing shows the presence, not the absence of defects**
* it **can show that *defects* are present** in the *test object*, but **cannot prove that there are no *defects*** (Buxton 1970)
* it **reduces the probability of *defects* remaining undiscovered**

**2. exhaustive testing is impossible**
* **testing everything is not feasible** except in trivial cases (Manna 1978)
* **rather than attempting to test exhaustively**,
  + ***test techniques***,
  + ***test case* prioritization**,
  + and ***risk-based testing***,
  + ... should be used to focus test efforts

**3. early testing saves time and money**
* ***defects* that are removed early in the process will not cause subsequent *defects*** in derived work products
* **the cost of quality will be reduced** since fewer *failures* will occur later in the SDLC
* **both *static testing* and *dynamic testing*** should be started as early as possible

**4. defects cluster together**
* **a small number of system components usually contain most of the *defects***
  + –> ***Pareto principle***
* **predicted defect clusters, and actual defect clusters observed** are an **important input for *risk-based testing***

**5. tests wear out**
* if the **same tests are repeated many times,**
  + **they become increasingly ineffective** in detecting new *defects*
* to overcome this effect,
  + **existing tests & *test data* may need to be modified**,
  + **new tests may need to be written**
* **in some cases, repeating the same tests can have a beneficial outcome**,
  + eg. in *automated regression testing*

**6. testing is context dependent**
* **no single universally applicable approach to testing**
* testing is **done differently in different contexts**

**7. absence-of-defects fallacy**
* it is a **misconception to expect that software verification will ensure the success** of a system
* **thoroughly testing** all requirements **and fixing** all *defects* found **could still produce a system**
  + that does not fulfill the users’ needs and expectations,
  + that does not help in achieving the customer’s business goals, and
  + that is inferior compared to other competing systems
* **in addition to *verification*, *validation* should also** be carried out
