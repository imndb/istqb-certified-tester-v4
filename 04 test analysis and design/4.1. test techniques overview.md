# 4.1. Test Techniques Overview

***test techniques***
* support the tester
  + in *test analysis*: what to test
  + in *test design*: how to test
* help to develop a relatively small, but sufficient, set of *test cases* in a systematic way
* also help the tester
  + to define *test conditions*,
  + identify *coverage items*,
  + identify *test data* during the *test analysis* and *design*
* further info on *test techniques* and their corresponding measures:
  + in the ISO/IEC/IEEE 29119-4 standard,
  + in (Beizer 1990, Craig 2002, Copeland 2004, Koomen 2006, Jorgensen 2014, Ammann 2016, Forgács 2019)

in this syllabus, *test techniques* are **classified as**:
* **black-box**
* **white-box**
* **experience-based**

***black-box test techniques*** (aka specification-based techniques)
* are based on an analysis of the specified behavior of the *test object*
  + without reference to its internal structure
  + so the *test cases* are independent of how the software is implemented
* so if the implementation changes, but the required behavior stays the same,
  + then the *test cases* are still useful

***white-box test techniques*** (aka structure-based techniques)
* are based on an analysis of the *test object*’s internal structure and processing
* as the *test cases* are dependent on how the software is designed,
  + they can only be created after the design or implementation of the *test object*

***experience-based test techniques***
* effectively use the knowledge and experience of testers for the design and implementation of *test cases*
* the effectiveness of these techniques depends heavily on the tester’s skills
* they can detect *defects* that may be missed using the *black-box* and *white-box test techniques*
* they are complementary to the *black-box* and *white-box test techniques*
