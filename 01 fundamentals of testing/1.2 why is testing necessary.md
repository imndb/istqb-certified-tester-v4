# 1.2 Why is Testing Necessary?

*testing*, as a form of quality control,
* **helps in achieving the agreed upon goals within** the set scope, time, quality, and budget constraints

testing’s contribution to success **should not be restricted to the test team activities**
* **any stakeholder can** use their testing skills to bring the project closer to success
* testing components, systems, and associated documentation **helps**
  + **to identify *defects*** in software,
  + [**to meet** contractual or legal **requirements** or industry-specific **standards**] (inserted from v3)

## 1.2.1 Testing’s Contributions to Success

provides a **cost-effective means of detecting *defects***
* these *defects* can then be removed (by debugging – a non-testing activity),
* so testing indirectly contributes to higher quality *test objects*

provides a **means of directly evaluating the quality** of a *test object* **at various stages in the SDLC**
* these measures are used as part of a larger project management activity,
* contributing to decisions to move to the next stage of the SDLC,
  + such as the release decision

provides users with **indirect representation on the development project**
* testers ensure that their understanding of users’ needs are considered throughout the development lifecycle
  + the alternative is to involve a representative set of users as part of the development project,
  + which is not usually possible due to the high costs and lack of availability of suitable users

**may also be required** to meet contractual or legal requirements, or to comply with regulatory standards.

## 1.2.2 Testing and Quality Assurance (QA)

the terms ***testing* and *quality assurance* (QA)** are often used interchangeably, but they are **not the same**
* **testing is a major form of quality control (QC)**
  + while others include formal methods (model checking and proof of correctness), simulation and prototyping
  + **QC is a product-oriented, corrective approach**
    - it focuses on activities supporting the achievement of appropriate levels of quality
* **QA is a process-oriented, preventive approach** that focuses on the implementation and improvement of processes
  + it works on the basis that if a good process is followed correctly, then it will generate a good product
  + applies to both the development and testing processes, and is the responsibility of everyone on a project

***test results* are used by QA and QC**
* **in QC** they are used to fix *defects*
* **in QA** they provide feedback on how well the development and test processes are performing

## 1.2.3 Errors, Defects, Failures, and Root Causes

human beings **make *errors*** (mistakes), which **produce *defects*** (faults, bugs), which in turn **may result in *failures***
* **possible reasons**: eg. time pressure, complexity of work products, processes, infrastructure or interactions, or simply because they are tired or lack adequate training

***defects* can be found**
* **in documentation**, eg.
  + a requirements specification or
  + a test script
* **in source code**,
  + if a *defect* in code is executed, the system may fail to do what it should do, or do something it shouldn’t, causing a *failure*
* **in a supporting artifact** such as a build file
  + produced earlier in the SDLC, if undetected, often lead to defective artifacts later in the lifecycle
* some *defects*
  + will **always** result in a *failure* if executed,
  + others will only result in a *failure* **in specific circumstances**,
  + some may **never** result in a *failure*


***errors* and *defects* are not the only cause of *failures***
* *failures* can also be **caused by environmental conditions**,
  + eg. when radiation or electromagnetic field cause *defects* in firmware

**a *root cause* is a fundamental reason for the occurrence of a problem** (e.g., a situation that leads to an *error*)
* ***root causes* are identified through *root cause analysis***
  + typically performed when a *failure* occurs or a *defect* is identified
* it is believed that **further similar *failures* or *defects* can be prevented** or their frequency reduced
  + **by addressing the *root cause***, such as by removing it
