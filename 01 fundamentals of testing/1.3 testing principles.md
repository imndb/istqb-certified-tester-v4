# 1.3 Testing Principles

A number of testing principles offering general guidelines applicable to all testing have been suggested over the years. This syllabus describes seven such principles.

**1. testing shows the presence, not the absence of defects**
* it **can show that *defects* are present** in the *test object*, but **cannot prove that there are no *defects*** (Buxton 1970)
* it **reduces the probability of *defects* remaining undiscovered** in the *test object*,
  + but even if no *defects* are found, testing cannot prove *test object* correctness

**2. exhaustive testing is impossible**
* **testing everything is not feasible** except in trivial cases (Manna 1978)
* **rather than attempting to test exhaustively**,
  + ***test techniques*** (see chapter 4),
  + ***test case* prioritization** (see section 5.1.5),
  + and ***risk-based testing*** (see section 5.2),
  + ... should be used to focus test efforts

**3. early testing saves time and money**
* ***defects* that are removed early in the process will not cause subsequent *defects*** in derived work products
* **the cost of quality will be reduced** since fewer *failures* will occur later in the SDLC (Boehm 1981)
* to find *defects* early, **both *static testing*** (see chapter 3) **and *dynamic testing*** (see chapter 4) should be started as early as possible

**4. defects cluster together**
* **a small number of system components usually contain most of the *defects*** discovered or are responsible for most of the operational failures (Enders 1975)
  + this phenomenon is an illustration of the **Pareto principle**
* **predicted defect clusters, and actual defect clusters observed** during testing or in operation, are an **important input for *risk-based testing*** (see section 5.2)

**5. tests wear out**
* if the **same tests are repeated many times,**
  + **they become increasingly ineffective** in detecting new *defects* (Beizer 1990).
* to overcome this effect,
  + **existing tests and *test data* may need to be modified**, and
  + **new tests may need to be written**
* although, **in some cases, repeating the same tests can have a beneficial outcome**,
  + eg. in *automated regression testing* (see section 2.2.3)

**6. testing is context dependent**
* there is **no single universally applicable approach to testing**
* testing is **done differently in different contexts** (Kaner 2011)

**7. absence-of-defects fallacy**
* it is a fallacy / **misconception to expect that software verification will ensure the success** of a system
* **thoroughly testing** all the specified requirements **and fixing** all the *defects* found **could still produce a system**
  + that does not fulfill the users’ needs and expectations,
  + that does not help in achieving the customer’s business goals, and
  + that is inferior compared to other competing systems
* **in addition to *verification*, *validation* should also** be carried out (Boehm 1981)
