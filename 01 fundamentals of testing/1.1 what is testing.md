# 1.1 What is Testing?

**Software testing** def.:
* a set of activities to discover *defects* and evaluate the quality of software artifacts.
* These artifacts, when being tested, are known as *test objects*
* it assesses software quality and helps reducing the *risk* of software *failure* in operation

**common misconception #1**:
* testing only consists of executing tests
* however:
  + it also includes other activities,
  + it must be aligned with the *software development lifecycle*

**common misconception #2**:
* testing focuses entirely on verifying the *test object*
* however:
  + while testing involves *verification*: checking whether the system meets specified requirements,
  + it also involves *validation*: checking whether the system meets users’ and other stakeholders’ needs in its operational environment

Testing may be ***dynamic* or *static***
* **dynamic testing** involves the execution of software,
  + uses different types of *test techniques* and test approaches to derive *test cases* (see chapter 4).
* **static testing** does not
  + it includes reviews (see chapter 3) and *static analysis*

testing is **not only a technical activity**:
* it needs to be properly **planned, managed, estimated, monitored** and **controlled** (see chapter 5)
* testers use tools (see chapter 6), but it is **largely an intellectual activity**:
  + requiring the testers to have specialized knowledge,
  + use analytical skills,
  + apply critical thinking and systems thinking (Myers 2011, Roman 2018).
  + The ISO/IEC/IEEE 29119-1 standard provides further information about software testing concepts.

## 1.1.1. Test Objectives

**typical test objectives**:
* evaluating work products such as requirements, user stories, designs, and code
* triggering *failures* and finding *defects*
* ensuring required *coverage* of a test object
* reducing the level of *risk* of inadequate software quality
* *verifying* whether specified requirements have been fulfilled
* *verifying* that a test object complies with contractual, legal, and regulatory requirements
* providing information to stakeholders to allow them to make informed decisions
* building confidence in the quality of the *test object*
* *validating* whether the test object is complete and works as expected by the stakeholders

objectives of testing can **vary, depending upon the context**, which includes:
* the work product being tested,
* the *test level*,
* *risks*,
* the *software development lifecycle* (SDLC) being followed,
* factors related to the business context,
  + e.g., corporate structure, competitive considerations, or time to market

## 1.1.2. Testing and Debugging

Testing and debugging are separate activities

**Testing**
* can trigger *failures* that are caused by *defects* in the software (*dynamic testing*)
* or can directly find *defects* in the *test object* (*static testing*)

**Debugging**
* **When *dynamic testing* (see chapter 4) triggers a *failure***, debugging is concerned with:
  + finding causes of this *failure* (*defects*), analyzing these causes, and eliminating them
  + The **typical debugging process** in this case involves:
    - Reproduction of a *failure*
    - Diagnosis (finding the *root cause*)
    - Fixing the cause
  + Subsequent *confirmation testing* checks whether the fixes resolved the problem
    - Preferably, *confirmation testing* is done by the same person who performed the initial test
    - Subsequent *regression testing* can also be performed, to check whether the fixes are causing *failures* in other parts of the *test object*
    - see section 2.2.3 for *confirmation testing* and *regression testing*
* **When *static testing* identifies a *defect***, debugging is concerned with removing it
  + no need for reproduction or diagnosis, since *static testing* directly finds defects, and cannot cause *failures* (see chapter 3).
