# 1.4. Test Activities, Testware and Test Roles

**Testing is context dependent, but**, at a high level, there are **common sets of test activities**
* without which testing is less likely to achieve test objectives
* these sets of test activities **form a test process**
  + the test process can be tailored to a given situation based on various factors
    - which test activities are included in this test process, how they are implemented, and when they occur
    - is normally decided as part of the *test planning* for the specific situation (see section 5.1)

the following sections describe the general aspects of this test process in terms of:
* test activities and tasks,
* the impact of context,
* testware,
* traceability between the test basis and testware,
* testing roles

The ISO/IEC/IEEE 29119-2 standard provides further information about test processes.

## 1.4.1. Test Activities and Tasks

a test process usually consists of the **main groups of activities** described below
* although many of these activities may **appear to follow a logical sequence**, they are **often implemented iteratively or in parallel**
* they usually need to be tailored to the system and the project

**test planning** consists of:
* defining the *test objectives* and
* then selecting an approach that best achieves the objectives within the constraints imposed by the overall context
* *test planning* is further explained in section 5.1

**test monitoring and control**
* *Test monitoring* involves the ongoing checking of all test activities and the comparison of actual progress against the plan
* *Test control* involves taking the actions necessary to meet the objectives of testing
* both are further explained in section 5.3

**test analysis**
* includes **analyzing the *test basis***
  + to identify testable features and
  + to define and prioritize associated *test conditions*, together with the related *risks* and *risk levels* (see section 5.2).
* the ***test basis* and the *test objects* are also evaluated**
  + to identify *defects* they may contain and to assess their testability
* often supported by the use of *test techniques* (see chapter 4)
* answers the question **“what to test?”** in terms of measurable coverage criteria

**test design**
* includes **elaborating the *test conditions* into *test cases* and other *testware*** (eg. test charters)
  + this often involves the **identification of *coverage items***, which serve as a guide to specify *test case* inputs
* ***test techniques*** (see chapter 4) can be used **to support** this activity
* also includes:
  + **defining the *test data*** requirements,
  + **designing the test environment** and identifying any other required infrastructure and tools
* test design answers the question **“how to test?”**

**test implementation**
* includes **creating / acquiring the *testware* necessary** for test execution (eg. *test data*)
* ***test cases* can be organized into *test procedures*** and are often **assembled into test suites**
* manual and automated **test scripts are created**
* ***test procedures* are prioritized and arranged within a *test execution* schedule** for efficient *test execution* (see section 5.1.5)
* the **test environment is built and verified** to be set up correctly

**test execution**
* includes **running the tests** in accordance with the *test execution* schedule (test runs)
* may be **manual** or **automated**
* **can take many forms**, including continuous testing or pair testing sessions
* actual test **results are compared with the expected results**
* the test results are **logged**
* **anomalies are analyzed** to identify their likely causes
  + this analysis allows us to **report the anomalies** based on the *failures* observed (see section 5.5)

**test completion** activities
* **usually occur at project milestones**
  + (e.g., release, end of iteration, test level completion)
  + for any unresolved *defects*, **change requests** or **product backlog** items created
* any **testware** that may be useful in the future is **identified and archived or handed over** to the appropriate teams
* the **test environment is shut down** to an agreed state
* the **test activities are analyzed**
  + to identify lessons learned and improvements for future iterations, releases, or projects (see section 2.1.6)
* a ***test completion report* is created and communicated** to the stakeholders

## 1.4.2. Test Process in Context

testing is not performed in isolation
* test activities are an integral part of the development processes carried out within an organization
* testing is also funded by stakeholders and its final goal is to help fulfill the stakeholders’ business needs

Therefore, the way the testing is carried out will depend on a number of contextual factors including:
* **stakeholders**
  + needs, expectations, requirements, willingness to cooperate, etc.
* **team members**
  + skills, knowledge, level of experience, availability, training needs, etc.
* **business domain**
  + criticality of the test object, identified risks, market needs, specific legal regulations, etc.
* **technical factors**
  + type of software, product architecture, technology used, etc.
* **project constraints**
  + scope, time, budget, resources, etc.
* **organizational factors**
  + organizational structure, existing policies, practices used, etc.
* **software development lifecycle**
  + engineering practices, development methods, etc.
* **tools**
  + availability, usability, compliance, etc.

These factors will have an impact on many test-related issues, including:
* test strategy, test techniques used, degree of test automation, required level of coverage, level of detail of test documentation, reporting, etc.

## 1.4.3. Testware

**testware is created as output work products** from the test activities described in section 1.4.1.
* here is a significant variation in how different organizations produce, shape, name, organize and manage their work products
* proper configuration management (see section 5.4) ensures consistency and integrity of work products

The following list of work products is not exhaustive:
* **test planning work products** include:
  + test plan, test schedule, risk register, and entry and exit criteria (see section 5.1)
    - Risk register is a list of risks together with risk likelihood, risk impact and information about risk mitigation (see section 5.2)
    - Test schedule, risk register and entry and exit criteria are often a part of the test plan
* **test monitoring and control work products** include:
  + test progress reports (see section 5.3.2), documentation of control directives (see section 5.3) and risk information (see section 5.2)
* **test analysis work products** include:
  + (prioritized) test conditions (e.g., acceptance criteria, see section 4.5.2), and defect reports regarding defects in the test basis (if not fixed directly)
* **test design work products** include:
  + (prioritized) test cases, test charters, coverage items, test data requirements and test environment requirements
* **test implementation work products** include:
  + test procedures, automated test scripts, test suites, test data, test execution schedule, and test environment elements
    - Examples of test environment elements include: stubs, drivers, simulators, and service virtualizations
* **test execution work products** include:
  + test logs, and defect reports (see section 5.5)
* **test completion work products** include:
  + test completion report (see section 5.3.2), action items for improvement of subsequent projects or iterations, documented lessons learned, and change requests (e.g., as product backlog items)

## 1.4.4. Traceability between the Test Basis and Testware

in order to implement effective test monitoring and control, it is important to **establish and maintain traceability** throughout the test process
* **between** the *test basis* elements, *testware* associated with these elements (e.g., test conditions, *risks*, *test cases*), *test results*, and detected *defects*

accurate traceability supports **coverage evaluation**, so it is very useful if **measurable *coverage criteria*** are defined in the test basis
* the *coverage criteria* can **function as key performance indicators** to drive the activities that show to what extent the test objectives have been achieved (see section 1.1.1). eg.:
  + **traceability of *test cases* to requirements** can verify that the requirements are covered by *test cases*
  + **traceability of test results to *risks*** can be used to evaluate the level of residual risk in a *test object*

in addition to evaluating coverage, **good traceability also**
* makes it possible to determine the impact of changes, facilitates test audits, and helps meet IT governance criteria
* also makes test progress and completion reports more easily understandable by including the status of test basis elements
  + this can also assist in communicating the technical aspects of testing to stakeholders in an understandable manner
* provides information to assess product quality, process capability, and project progress against business goals

## 1.4.5. Roles in Testing

in this syllabus, two principal roles in testing are covered: a **test management role** and a **testing role**
* the activities and tasks assigned to these two roles **depend on** factors such as
  + the **project and product context**,
  + the **skills of the people** in the roles, and **the organization**

the **test management role**
* takes **overall responsibility for the test process, test team and leadership of** the test activities
* **mainly focused on the activities of** test planning, test monitoring and control and test completion
* the way in which the test management role is carried out **varies depending on the context**
  + eg. in Agile software development, some of the test management tasks may be handled by the Agile team
  + tasks that span multiple teams or the entire organization may be performed by test managers outside of the development team

the **testing role**
* takes **overall responsibility for the engineering** (technical) aspect of testing
* is **mainly focused on the activities of** *test analysis*, *test design*, test implementation and test execution

**different people may take on these roles at different times**:
* eg. the test management role can be performed by a team leader, by a test manager, by a development manager, etc.
* it is also possible for one person to take on the roles of testing and test management at the same time
