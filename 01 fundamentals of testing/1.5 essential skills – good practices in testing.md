# 1.5.Essential Skills and Good Practices in Testing

**skill** def.:
* the ability to do something well that comes from one’s knowledge, practice and aptitude

good testers' **essential skills**:
* should be **effective team players**
* should be **able to perform testing** on different levels of test independence

## 1.5.1. Generic Skills Required for Testing

while being generic, the following skills are particularly relevant for testers:
* **testing knowledge**
  + to increase effectiveness of testing, eg. by using *test techniques*
* **thoroughness, carefulness, curiosity, attention to details, being methodical**
  + to identify *defects*, especially the ones that are difficult to find
* **good communication skills, active listening, being a team player**
  + to interact effectively with all stakeholders,
  + to convey information to others,
  + to be understood,
  + to report and discuss defects
* **analytical thinking, critical thinking, creativity**
  + to increase effectiveness of testing
* **technical knowledge**
  + to increase efficiency of testing, eg. by using appropriate test tools
* **domain knowledge**
  + to be able to understand & to communicate with end users/business representatives

importance of **communication skills**
* testers are often the **bearers of bad news**
  + it is a common human trait to **blame** the bearers of bad news
  + this makes **communication skills** crucial for testers
* communicating test results **may be perceived as criticism** of the product and of its author
* **Confirmation bias** can make it difficult to accept information that disagrees with currently held beliefs
* some **people may perceive testing as a destructive activity**,
  + even though it contributes greatly to project success and product quality
  + to try to improve this view, information about defects and failures should be communicated in a constructive way

## 1.5.2. Whole Team Approach

**the whole team approach** def.
* a practice **coming from Extreme Programming** (see section 2.1)
* builds upon the **skill of working effectively in a team context** and contributing positively to the team goals
  + it improves team dynamics,
  + enhances communication and collaboration within the team,
  + creates synergy by allowing the various skill sets within the team to be leveraged for the benefit of the project

**in the whole-team approach**
* **any team member** with the necessary knowledge and skills **can perform any task**
  + and **everyone is responsible** for quality
* the **team members share the same workspace** (physical or virtual)
  + as co-location facilitates communication and interaction

**testers work closely with other team members** to ensure that the desired quality levels are achieved
* **with business representatives** to help them create suitable acceptance tests
* **with developers** to agree on the test strategy and decide on test automation approaches
* **testers can thus transfer testing knowledge** to other team members and influence the development of the product

depending on the context, the whole team approach **may not always be appropriate**
  + eg. in some situations, such as safety-critical, a high level of test independence may be needed.

## 1.5.3. Independence of Testing

**test independence**:
* a certain degree of independence makes the tester more effective at finding defects
  + due to differences between **the author’s and the tester’s cognitive biases** (cf. Salman 1995)
* independence is not, however, a replacement for familiarity
  + eg. developers can efficiently find many defects in their own code

**work products can be tested**
* by their **author** (no independence),
* by the **author's peers** from the same team (some independence),
* by **testers from outside the author's team** but within the organization (high independence),
* by **testers from outside the organization** (very high independence).

for most projects, **it is usually best to carry out testing with multiple levels of independence**, eg.:
* **developers performing** component and component integration testing,
* **test team performing** system and system integration testing, and
* **business representatives** performing acceptance testing

the **main benefit of independence of testing**:
* independent testers are **likely to recognize different kinds of *failures*** and *defects* compared to developers
  + because of their different backgrounds, technical perspectives, and biases
* moreover, they **can verify, challenge, or disprove assumptions** made by stakeholders during specification and implementation of the system

**drawback of independence of testing: independent testers may be isolated** from the development team,
  + which may lead to a **lack of collaboration, communication problems, or an adversarial relationship** with the development team
  + developers may **lose a sense of responsibility** for quality
  + **independent testers may be seen as a bottleneck** or be blamed for delays in release
